# Triggers the nightly builds by tagging master branch
# We have to use a dedicated access token because events raised by workflows
# using GITHUB_TOKEN do not trigger other workflows:
# https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/events-that-trigger-workflows#about-workflow-events
# To create the token, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token
# And then to create the secret containing it, see:
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository
# Unfortunately, there's no way to limit the access token to a single repository
# or to just be allowed to tag, so this solution is not great.
