/*
  How to do music: 
    a) Download Arkos Tracker 2
    b) Create a 3-track song
    c) Export as AKG, source file, with some main filename like "mySong"
    d) In TRSE, use the "compile_akg_music" pre-processor command to compile the music + player
       to a format that TRSE can recognize. Also specify the desired memory location.
    e) The compiler has generated a .bin file - include this one 
    f) Music play/init locations are automatically extracted. All you need to do is call InitMusic(track) and
       call PlayMusic() on each frame.
