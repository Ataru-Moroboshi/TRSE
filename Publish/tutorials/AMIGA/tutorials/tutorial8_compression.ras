		as "compressed", the file will be automatically compressed
		and saved as a new file with ending +"_c". In this example,
		the compressed file will be named "image2.bin_c", and this file 
		will be included instead of the original. 
		
		All you need to do to decompress the data is to call the decompress
		method from the decompress library:
		
		Compression::Decompress(packed_data, target);
		
		Make sure that the target has enough of spare space when decompressing!
