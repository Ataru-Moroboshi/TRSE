<p>The game uses mode 1, with 2 16-color (4bpp) playfields for background / foreground graphics + a 4-color (2bpp) for the front text layer. 
<p>The levels (levels.flf) are drawn using 2x2 meta tiles. The 8x8 tiles are defined in "tiles.flf", and the 2x2 meta are built from the various 8x8 tiles in "tiles.flf" - enabling individual horizontal/vertical flipping etc. 
<p>Sprites are in "sprites.flf"
