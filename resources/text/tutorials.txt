Most of the demos created with TRSE used this ray tracer to produce several of the effects. <p>You program your scenes in Lua, and then run the Fjong 3D program with CTRL+R. <p>The lua script used in TRSE has been expanded with a bunch of useful commands for compressing and exporting user-defined 8-bit data!
