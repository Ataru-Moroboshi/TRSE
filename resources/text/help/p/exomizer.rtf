Exomizer is the go-to compression system for 6502 systems, and can be obtained from here : https://bitbucket.org/magli143/exomizer/wiki/Home
<p>
In order to use exomizer in TRSE, you need to set the correct exomizer path in the TRSE settings menu.
<p>
When the exomizer toggle is on, the executable will be compressed after compiling/assembling. The executable will
then self-expand when executed on the target platform.
