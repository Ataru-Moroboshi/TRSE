<p>TRU files are TRSE units (libraries). TRUs can be included from other projects. TRU files are first included from
the internal TRSE tru directory found in "[ program folder ]/tutorials/[ current system ]/tru", but if a specific file
is not found here, the current project folder is searched instead.
<p>TRU files can include other TRU files. Unused methods will be removed on compile.
