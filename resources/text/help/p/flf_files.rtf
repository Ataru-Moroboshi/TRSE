<p>FLF files are TRSE image files. All image types are stored as the binary FLF format - from sprites to images to levels, PETSCII and animations.
<p>FLF files can be automatically exported to their respective native format (on a C64/VIC20/Gameboy etc) via the @export preprocessor directive.
<code>
@export "myImage.flf" "myImage.bin" 256
</code>
