<h3>PPUPoint([hi] , [lo])</h3>
PPUpoints sets up the PPU registers to point to address [hi][lo] :

<code>
    // Point to first colour attribute in first nametable $23C0
    PPUPoint($23,$C0);
    // Write walue zero
    PPUWrite(0);
    // PPU now points to $23C1.
    i:=PPURead(); // Reads value of $23C1 into I, increments to $23C2
    PPUWrite(i); // Writes value of "i" to $23C2
</code>
