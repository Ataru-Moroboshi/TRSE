<h3>[byte] = IsOverlappingWH( [byte x1], [byte y1], [byte x2], [byte y2], [byte width], [byte height] );</h3>
<ul>
<li>[byte x1] - the x position of the first point</li>
<li>[byte y1] - the y position of the first point</li>
<li>[byte x2] - the x position of the second point</li>
<li>[byte y2] - the y position of the second point</li>
<li>[byte width] - the distance to check between the two points on the x axis</li>
<li>[byte height] - the distance to check between the two points on the y axis</li>
</ul>


<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Fast collision test between two points. Returns 1 if [x1/y1] is within [width / height] of [x2/y2], otherwise returns 0.</p>
<p>The distance is tested on the x and y positions and so collision is within a rectangle rather than a straight line distance.
Suitable testing for 'hitboxes' between two sprites for example.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This version only accepts byte parameters.  To test x position of sprites you must scale the
two x positions down to fit between 0 and 255.  For example divide by 2 or subtract to bring both values below 256.
A future version will support integers.</p>
<p><strong>Assembler Optmisation:</strong> If you pass a constant ( eg: 10 or @MyConstant ) or a variable as a parameter,
the code produced will be smaller.  If pass in a calculation, bear in mind additional code will be created.  If you are
performing many IsOverapping tests in a loop, do the calculations outside the loop if possible.</p>

<p>Future versions</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<code>
result := IsOverlappingWH( x,y, enemyx,enemyy, 20, 30 );  // returns 1 if x,y is within 20 width and 30 height of enemyx,enemyy
result := IsOverlappingWH( 100,100, x,y, r*2, r );  // returns 1 if x,y is within [r*2] width and r height of 100,100
</code>
