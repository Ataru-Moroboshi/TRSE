<p>Loads a compressed file from disk using the Krill loader system in TRSE. 
<p>Works exactly the same way as <b>KrillLoad</b>, but requires the file to be compressed
using TinyCrunch. 
<p>Compressing with TinyCrunch can be performed with TRSE by typing "1" into the "compressed" field in the d64 PAW file. Compress by compiling the paw file (ctrl+B)
<p>You must have downloaded TinyCrunch+python installed + and having set up the link in the TRSE settings dialog.
