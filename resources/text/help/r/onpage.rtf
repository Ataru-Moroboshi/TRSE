<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Add to code blocks to force an on-page BCC or BCS branch. On-page branches require the code block
    to be less than 256 bytes in length. This is the default option when TRSE thinks the code 
    block is less than 256 bytes.
</p>
<p>Can be added to IF, WHILE and FOR loops.</p>


<h3>Example</h3>

<code>
while (true) onpage do
begin

  // less than 256 bytes of code

end;
</code>
