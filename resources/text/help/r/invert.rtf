<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Used with CSTRING to invert the character, essentially setting bit 7 (128) so Commodore PETSCII will be displayed with the inverted character style.
This is a useful modifier for the Vic 20 in particular, when the character set is set to the address $1c00, only 64 characters are definable in the
address range that ends at $2000. However, the Vic 20 will wrap around into the ROM character set address space and luckily inverted character codes
are then mapped to the regular character set. In other words the first 128 PETSCII character codes in the ROM are mapped to the PETSCII codes 128 
through to 255 when displayed on the screen.</p>
