<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Preprocessor that exports a TRSE image file (.flf) to binary on build in a format suitable for the
    Vic Bitmap Mode (VBM).</p>
<p>
    VBM export takes five parameters.  
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The source flf file</li>
    <li>The destination bin file to create</li>
    <li>The start character (see character height)</li>
    <li>The end character (see character height)</li>
    <li>The character height</li>
</ul>
<p>The character height allows taller characters to be exported.  If set to 1, characters are exported
    normally as 1x1 characters.  If set at 2, characters are exported as 1x2 from the FLF bitmap.
</p>
<p>The character height also changes how the start and end characters are calculated.
</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
The follow example will export 10 characters, starting at character 0, with a character height of 2 characters 
from the .flf charset file to a binary file.
<code>
program VBMExport;

@export "sprite/mySprite.flf" "sprite/mySprite.bin" 0 10 2
var
    mySprite : incbin("sprite/mySprite.bin",$2000);

begin
    Loop();
end.
</code>
