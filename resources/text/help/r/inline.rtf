<h3>Description</h3>
<p>
Procedures are normally called, in 6502 with a JSR.  Inline changes the behaviour
of the procedure to become more like a macro.  Instead of it being called, the code
contained within the procedure is written 'inline' and no return (rts in 6502) is needed.

<h3>Example</h3>

<code>
procedure MacroProcedure() inline;
begin
    // do something
end;
</code>
