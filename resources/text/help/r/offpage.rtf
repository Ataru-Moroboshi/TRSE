<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Add to code blocks to force an off-page JMP (jump). Off-page branches will work at any time but take up 
    one additional byte for an absolute address.  They are needed when the code block is more than 256 bytes 
    in length. This is the default option when TRSE thinks the code block is more than 256 bytes.
</p>
<p>Can be added to IF, WHILE and FOR loops.</p>


<h3>Example</h3>

<code>
while (true) offpage do
begin

  // more than 256 bytes of code

end;
</code>
